**Key Features:**
1. Conducted thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure data quality.
2. Visualized model results and key insights using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. Utilized eight machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and others, to predict heart disease presence.
4. Employed various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC scores to assess model performance, with a focus on early detection.
5. Explored the trade-offs between model interpretability and predictive power to provide a range of options for healthcare professionals.


**Results:**
1. Identified the top-performing models for heart disease prediction, including SGD Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree with their respective metrics.
2. Uncovered valuable patterns during the EDA phase that shed light on key factors contributing to heart disease risk.


**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
3. Run Jupyter notebooks or scripts provided to replicate the analysis or make predictions on new data.
4. Customize and fine-tune the models to suit specific clinical or research use cases related to heart disease prediction.
